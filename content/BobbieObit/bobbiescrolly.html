          "Wanderlust" photographer and filmmaker who showed a different side of Ghana

        <br>
      </p> While on holiday in northern Italy to celebrate his wife’s 40th birthday, Emmanuel Bobbie was filmed in a comic video in which he made an impression of a Ghanaian immigrant sending a message to friends and family back home. The impression, inspired by a popular Ghanaian travel show, was widely shared on social media, and later, he joked about how many believed it was real.</p>
      <br>
    </p>But it was classic Bobbie: a jovial, funny, and bonhomie personality that even February winter in the Italian Alps couldn’t quell. Just days after returning home to Accra, northern Italy was placed into lockdown and the viciousness of the new coronavirus was finally broadcast to the world.</p>
    <br>
  </p>Nearly a year after that holiday, Bobbie became sick as a second wave of the virus, spurred by fast-spreading variants, gripped Ghana. He died on Feb. 25, 2021, at a hospital in Accra. He was 44 years old. The cause was complications of Covid-19, his wife Aba Aborkumah Essel said.</p>

            <p>
              From Ghana’s coast to the inland savannah grasslands, Bobbie’s travel photos and later in his career, videos, showed a different side of the country to its own people and the rest of the world.</p>
              
              <p>
                “He had a very strong wanderlust,” said the photographer and broadcaster David Kwaku Saforo Sakyi, whose wedding Bobbie was the groomsman. “The road was a place of peace, a place of relaxation,” said Sakyi who traveled with him many times.</p>
              <p>Bobbie was also interested in using his talent to challenge stereotypical narratives about the country and the continent, narratives that were often not seen in the world’s major publications. “Too many picture books have been created by non-Ghanaians, non-Africans, and it was time for us to change the narrative and so for him, this was also a driving passion,” Sakyi said.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-image= "url(Bobbie7!!!.jpeg)">
            <p>In Bobbie’s work, the beaches and the mountains are scenic and the people are enterprising. They are cheerful farmers, eccentric artists, or simply playful boys hunting crabs at the beach. He often photographed rural artisans at work and on occasion, printed and framed the photos and personally sent them back to the subjects.

            <p>But at the core of his visual craft, the human face in an intimate portrait was everything Bobbie sought after with his camera.</p>
              
              <p>“On my travels as a photographer, I have had people tell me amazing stories about themselves,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BViD2QABJSn/?utm_medium=copy_link"> he wrote in 2017</a>. “Others, however, have their stories told by their faces. The latter fascinates me more.”</p>
              <p>
                On one of his many travels documenting Ghana and how life is lived in the country, 
                Bobbie met Baba Abdulai. The elderly man was enchanted by the drone Bobbie and 
                his team had been using for aerial photography.</p>
              
              <p>
                “Can you make it bigger to take me to the Holy Land of Mecca?” 
                Abdulai asked. Bobbie’s photo showing Abdulai’s astonishment as he 
                held the drone went viral on social media. Thanks to the photo, 
                Abdulai's dream came true after the Turkish government sponsored his 
                trip to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage.</p>

          <div class="step" data-image= "url(Bobbie8!.jpeg)">
            <p>Emmanuel Akwasi Yeboah Bobbie was born on Aug. 1, 1976, in 
              Accra to Thomas Kwabena Bobbie who worked at the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation and Agnes 
              Akua Afriyie, a trader. He was the third of their six children. He 
              studied art in secondary school and in 2001 graduated with a degree 
              in Communication Design from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science 
              and Technology in Kumasi.</p>
            

              <p>In 2003, Bobbie married Ms. Essel, who he met in 1998. After marriage, 
                she moved to the United Kingdom where Bobbie worked at a string of 
                companies including the Royal Mail and the department store Asda. The 
                young couple struggled to find their feet in their new south London home.
              </p>
              
              <p><em><strong>“We felt there was nothing there for us; we had our 
                whole lives here in Ghana,”</em></strong> said Ms. Essel. After a well-paid contract to shoot a wedding in Ghana, Bobbie decided to pivot to photography full time and the 
                couple moved back to Accra in 2006.</p>
              
              <p>After resettling, Bobbie’s photography career grew rapidly. 
                He established the Bob Pixel Photography studio and gradually weaned 
                himself off weddings to making images for corporate Ghana and artists. 
                Notably, he photographed the cover of rapper 
                M.anifest’s acclaimed album Apae.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-image= "url(Bobbie6!!!.jpeg)">
            <p>His mantra was “still learning” and in the last few years of his 
              life, he metamorphosed into a self-taught drone pilot and video 
              storyteller, making short films about life in Ghana. Before his death, 
              he wanted to exhibit more of his pieces, was working on publishing 
              a photo book, and expressed an interest in continuing to teach the 
              generation of Ghanaian visual storytellers.</p>
            
            <p>“When I think of Bob (as he was sometimes called) now, I think of the fact 
              that he was a lighthouse to my exploration,” said Gerard Nartey, 
              a landscape photographer and mentee of Bobbie. “He gave me a trail to 
              follow, anything I needed to ask, I could count on his experience,” 
              Nartey said.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to his wife, he is survived by three young children, his elderly mother, and five siblings.</p>
