          Professor of Pharmacology who fought against Covid-19 on varied fronts.

        <p class="byline">Written and reported by: Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu</p>
        <br>
      </p> As Ghana scrambled to contain the pandemic's early days, there was 
      nationwide worry about a key ingredient in the fight against the virus: hand sanitizers.</p>
      <br>
    </p>Panic buying of the alcohol gels led to shortages and an astronomical rise in prices. Faculty at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Kumasi, went into action to mass-produce the sanitizers for sale at a lower cost.
      As an associate professor of pharmacology, George Koffuor was in the thick of things. </p>

              “George would be stirring [the big drums] and the rest of us will be packaging and labeling,” Dr. Cynthia Amaning Danquah, a former student turned colleague lecturer of Prof. Koffuor said. </p>
              
              <p>
              When claims about the efficacy of herbal medicine against Covid-19 gained significant media and public attention, Prof. Koffuor was selected to be part of a government committee set up to establish a standardized way for local scientists like himself to test the claims made by the herbal producers.</p>
              
              <p>
              When universities reopened five months after they were forced to shut, he returned to the lecture rooms to teach pharmacology to the next generation of Ghana’s health professionals and continue his research up until three days before his death.
              </p>
              <p>Prof. Koffuor died at a hospital in Kumasi on Feb. 5, 2021. The cause was complications of Covid-19, the novel viral disease he helped to fight on varied fronts, his wife, Hilda Asaa Koffuor said. He was 49 years old.

            <p>George Kwasi Asumeng Koffuor was born on June 27, 1971, in Akuapem-Mampong in Ghana’s Eastern Region. His father George Asumeng Koffuor was a teacher and a reverend minister of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana and his mother, Ellen Kate Koffuor was also a teacher. Koffuor was the last of the couple’s six children and their only son.</p>
              <p>
              He began school in Accra but after his father was appointed as the Presbytery chairman for northern Ghana, 
              the family moved to Kumasi. There, the young Koffuor attended the 
              university’s primary school and was sent to live with the Right 
              Reverend Daniel Koranteng, who was then the moderator (the head) 
              of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. Koffuor completed his secondary 
              school education at Prempeh College in Kumasi and dropped out after a 
              year of studying Biological Sciences at the University of Cape Coast to 
              start a bachelor's degree in pharmacy and subsequently a master's degree 
              in pharmacology at KNUST.</p>
              <p>
              He turned down the opportunity of further study abroad on a 
              scholarship in order to take care of his elderly parents 
              since all his older sisters had their own families to take 
              care of, his wife said.</p>
              
              <p>The couple ‘met’ in 2002 on a phone call after a student of 
              Koffuor who didn’t own a cellphone used her neighbor Hilda 
              Asaa Wilson’s phone to contact him. They were married a year later.
              </p>

          <div class="step" data-image= "url(koffuor1.jpeg">
            <p>For his doctoral degree in 2012, also at KNUST, Koffuor researched the safety of herbal 
              antihypertensive medicines on the market in Ghana. In his scholarly career, he also 
              researched the immune response to herbal medicines in the 
              management of HIV/AIDS, the use of herbs in postnatal care, and 
              the effects of eyelash extensions on vision.</p>

              <p>He joined the faculty at the university as a teaching assistant in 2002 and after a string of faculty positions, 
                he was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 2015. 
                Prof Koffuor was appointed the head of the Department of Herbal 
                Medicine in 2018 and was reassigned to be the head of the Department 
                of Pharmacology in August 2020.</p>
              
              <p>There, he used his relationship with alumni to mobilize 
                funds to renovate the department’s animal house and began a 
                project to renovate the department’s labs, a mission that 
                has now been taken over by Dr. Danquah.</p>
              
              <p>To Dr. Danquah, Prof Koffuor would be remembered as 
                the helpful big brother and mentor she and everyone else 
                relied on. A day before her first day as a lecturer: 
                “George said: 'Bring your slides and let me see what you 
                are going to teach. Come and present and let me see,'” she 
                recalled. “If I don’t understand anything or 
                I need guidance, it is George, I would run to.”</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-image= "url(koffuor4.jpeg">
            <p>Prof. Koffuor’s biggest pet peeve was the wrong spelling of his 
              surname. Many notable Ghanaians, including a former president, 
              have a different spelling than his. He was especially frustrated 
              when people thought his version was wrong.</p>

              <p>There were times when his children had new teachers and 
              they would use red ink to “correct” the spelling of their surname, 
Mrs. Koffuor recalled.</p>
              
              <p> <em><strong>“He would leave the house, get to the school and stand on the teacher to 
              spell the name right before he leaves the class,</em></strong>” she said.</p>
              
            <p>When his secretary noticed that his surname was misspelled on a banner 
              announcing the traditional one-week memorial following his death, 
              a new one had to be printed. “He was very particular about it,” 
              Mrs. Koffuor added.</p>
              
              <p>Aside from his wife Hilda, a high school teacher, Prof. Koffuor is survived by two young daughters, Akosua Asantewaa, 13, and Yaa Tema, 11, and four sisters.
