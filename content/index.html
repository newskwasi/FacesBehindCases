      <h2>Ghana's Checkered Covid-19 response</h2>

      <p>After nearly four months with a handful of patients, the intensive care unit at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana’s capital, Accra, is full of activity again.</h3>

        <p>In a tropical country with an average daily temperature of 30 degrees celsius (86F), tight-fitting masks, goggles, coveralls, face shields, boots, and gloves make for a very uncomfortable gab for the doctors and nurses taking care of patients.</p>
        
        <p>Since July 2021, the third wave of coronavirus infections in the country, spurred on by the highly infectious Delta variant, means once again, the country’s limited intensive care beds are filling fast, leaving the entire health system feeling overstretched.</p>
        
        <p>“Our active cases have increased from 1,600 to over 6,000 in one month, ” said Dr. Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, the director-general of the Ghana Health Service, at a press briefing in early August. “We have increasing hospitalization and deaths,” the country’s topmost public health official said.</p>
        
      <p> Aside from the increase in cases, the profile of coronavirus patients is also changing.</p>
        
    <p><em><strong>“This time around, we are getting a lot of young people who are coming and are really really sick,”</em></strong>said Dr. Naa Martekuor Vanderpuye, a specialist anesthetist at Korle-Bu. (Because of a lack of intensivists, anesthetists in Ghana also perform additional duties as intensive care providers). “That is the scary bit, the way they deteriorate,” she said.</p>
        
      <h2><em>Good starters</em></h2>
        
      <p>Ghana announced its first two cases of Covid-19 infections on Mar. 12, 2020, a day after the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus a global pandemic. It was fast to institute measures to control the spread of the virus. Schools and universities were quickly closed and international borders were sealed to most passengers.</p> 
        
      <p>By the end of March, a lockdown had been instituted in Accra and Kumasi, its two biggest metropolitan areas.</p>
        
      <p>However, soon it became clear that its workforce (80 percent of whom are informal sector workers) couldn’t work from home and after three weeks, the lockdown was lifted but with a mandatory mask mandate in effect.</p>
        
      <p>After the first wave of infections subsided, the airport was reopened, masks gradually fell off, weddings were staged and as general elections in December 2020 drew closer, political rallies with teeming sympathizers happened across the country.</p>
        
      <p>“We had gone to sleep again, we had assumed that Covid was gone,” said Dr. Vanderpuye, who has attended to patients since the start of the pandemic.</p>
        
        <h2><em>New year of horror</em></h2>
        
          <p>As 2021 began, the effect of the relaxed posture towards the pandemic became evident in hospitals as a new wave of the virus ripped through the country.</p>
        
          <p>Ghana’s second wave of Covid-19 was its deadliest, with most infections caused by the highly transmissible Alpha and Beta variants, first discovered in the United Kingdom and South Africa. Nearly half of the 850 Covid-19 related deaths in Ghana reported as of early August happened between January and March 2021.</p>
        
          <p>There are fears among authorities and health professionals that the current third wave could be heading in the same direction or worse.</p>
        
          <p>“Fellow Ghanaians, it is obvious from the data that we have let our guard down, with many going about their daily duties in clear breach of and disregard for the protocols,” President Nana Akufo-Addo said in his latest television address before announcing a raft of new measures.</p>
         
          <h2><em>Leading by example</em></h2>
        
        <p>However, experts point to the president himself and other government officials for their public violation of Covid safety measures in contributing to the public’s non-adherence to prevention measures.</p> 
        
        <p>In June 2021, the president was criticized for attending the funeral of a party member which involved huge crowds, flouting his own directive limiting funerals to 25 people.</p>
        
        <p>In another case, a minister was forced to resign when he was found to have visited a voting registration center despite knowing he had the virus. Parliament was also closed following a cluster of infections after some members who had tested positive were found not to be self-isolating.</p>
        
        <p>“We have seen politicians not practicing what we are supposed to be practicing and doing it on a very visual scale,” said Dr. Nadia Sam-Agudu, associate professor of pediatrics with a specialty in infectious diseases at the University of Maryland. “It's become a do as I say, but not as I do situation,” she added.</p>
        
        <p>Last March, Dr. Sam-Agudu, who recently returned to the U.S. after living in Ghana for the past 18 months, co-authored a paper that was critical of the country’s handling of Covid-19. While she acknowledges Ghana started off well with an innovative way of mass testing Covid-19 samples and providing some economic relief to the public, she says the government has dropped the ball.</p>
        
        <p>“For the first part I would have given a B plus, but with what has gone on looking back from today and all the way back to March 2020, it’s a D,” she scored.</p>
        
        <h2><em>Vaccine desperation, not hesitancy</em></h2>
        
        <p>Ghana set an ambitious target of vaccinating 20 million out of its 31 million population by October 2021. But as of early August, 1.2 million vaccine doses had been administered with only about 400,000 people (1.2 percent of the population) fully vaccinated.</p>
        
        <p>This is emblematic of the poor vaccination rates seen across Africa and other low and middle-income countries. With richer countries having done megadeals with vaccine manufacturers, developing countries have struggled to purchase vaccines. </p>
        
        <p>As countries such as the United States offer incentives like cash and burgers in order to incentivize the vaccine-hesitant and skeptics, many countries like Ghana have had issues getting Covid vaccines to its most vulnerable: the elderly, frontline care workers, and those with underlying health conditions.</p>
        
        <p>It is a scenario experts such as Dr. Sam-Agudu - whose primary research is into HIV/AIDS - are all too familiar with, following the development of life-saving medication to manage the condition.</p>
        
        <p>“It happened with HIV, and it's happening very clearly with Covid,” she said. “We are sitting here with other countries having their vaccines up to two, three times of the population expiring in warehouses, and then there are Africans expiring at home, literally.”</p>
