Faculty at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Kumasi, went into action to mass-produce the sanitizers for sale at a lower cost. As an associate professor of pharmacology, George Koffuor was in the thick of things. <p></p> </section> <section id="scrolly"> <article> <div class="step" data-image="url(koffuor3.jpeg"> <p> “George would be stirring [the big drums] and the rest of us will be packaging and labeling,” Dr. Cynthia Amaning Danquah, a former student turned colleague lecturer of Prof. Koffuor said. </p> <p> When claims about the efficacy of herbal medicine against Covid-19 gained significant media and public attention, Prof. Koffuor was selected to be part of a government committee set up to establish a standardized way for local scientists like himself to test the claims made by the herbal producers.</p> <p> When universities reopened five months after they were forced to shut, he returned to the lecture rooms to teach pharmacology to the next generation of Ghana’s health professionals and continue his research up until three days before his death. </p> <p>Prof. Koffuor died at a hospital in Kumasi on Feb. 5, 2021. The cause was complications of Covid-19, the novel viral disease he helped to fight on varied fronts, his wife, Hilda Asaa Koffuor said. He was 49 years old. </p> </div> <div class="step" data-image="url(koffuor6.jpeg"> <p>George Kwasi Asumeng Koffuor was born on June 27, 1971, in Akuapem-Mampong in Ghana’s Eastern Region. His father George Asumeng Koffuor was a teacher and a reverend minister of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana and his mother, Ellen Kate Koffuor was also a teacher. Koffuor was the last of the couple’s six children and their only son.</p> <p> He began school in Accra but after his father was appointed as the Presbytery chairman for northern Ghana, the family moved to Kumasi. There, the young Koffuor attended the university’s primary school and was sent to live with the Right Reverend Daniel Koranteng, who was then the moderator (the head) of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. Koffuor completed his secondary school education at Prempeh College in Kumasi and dropped out after a year of studying Biological Sciences at the University of Cape Coast to start a bachelor's degree in pharmacy and subsequently a master's degree in pharmacology at KNUST.</p> <p> He turned down the opportunity of further study abroad on a scholarship in order to take care of his elderly parents since all his older sisters had their own families to take care of, his wife said.</p> <p>The couple ‘met’ in 2002 on a phone call after a student of Koffuor who didn’t own a cellphone used her neighbor Hilda Asaa Wilson’s phone to contact him. They were married a year later. </p> </div> <div class="step" data-image="url(koffuor1.jpeg"> <p>For his doctoral degree in 2012, also at KNUST, Koffuor researched the safety of herbal antihypertensive medicines on the market in Ghana. In his scholarly career, he also researched the immune response to herbal medicines in the management of HIV/AIDS, the use of herbs in postnatal care, and the effects of eyelash extensions on vision.</p> <p>He joined the faculty at the university as a teaching assistant in 2002 and after a string of faculty positions, he was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 2015. Prof Koffuor was appointed the head of the Department of Herbal Medicine in 2018 and was reassigned to be the head of the Department of Pharmacology in August 2020.</p> <p>There, he used his relationship with alumni to mobilize funds to renovate the department’s animal house and began a project to renovate the department’s labs, a mission that has now been taken over by Dr. Danquah.</p> <p>To Dr. Danquah, Prof Koffuor would be remembered as the helpful big brother and mentor she and everyone else relied on. A day before her first day as a lecturer: “George said: 'Bring your slides and let me see what you are going to teach. Come and present and let me see,'” she recalled. “If I don’t understand anything or I need guidance, it is George, I would run to.”</p> </div> <div class="step" data-image="url(koffuor4.jpeg"> <p>Prof. Koffuor’s biggest pet peeve was the wrong spelling of his surname. Many notable Ghanaians, including a former president, have a different spelling than his. He was especially frustrated when people thought his version was wrong.</p> <p>There were times when his children had new teachers and they would use red ink to “correct” the spelling of their surname, Mrs. Koffuor recalled.</p> <p> <em><strong>“He would leave the house, get to the school and stand on the teacher to spell the name right before he leaves the class,</strong></em>” she said.</p> <p>When his secretary noticed that his surname was misspelled on a banner announcing the traditional one-week memorial following his death, a new one had to be printed. “He was very particular about it,” Mrs. Koffuor added.</p> <p>Aside from his wife Hilda, a high school teacher, Prof. Koffuor is survived by two young daughters, Akosua Asantewaa, 13, and Yaa Tema, 11, and four sisters. </p> </div> </article> <div class="sticky-thing"> </div> </section> <section id="outro"></section> </main>  <script src="https://unpkg.com/intersection-observer@0.5.1/intersection-observer.js"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/scrollama"></script> <script>var e=document.querySelector("main"),t=e.querySelector("#scrolly"),r=t.querySelector(".sticky-thing"),s=t.querySelector("article"),c=s.querySelectorAll(".step"),a=scrollama();function i(e){var t=e.element;c.forEach(function(e){return e.classList.remove("is-active")}),t.classList.add("is-active"),r.style.backgroundImage=t.dataset.image}function l(){a.setup({step:"#scrolly article .step",offset:.33}).onStepEnter(i),window.addEventListener("resize",a.resize)}l();</script> </body></html>
