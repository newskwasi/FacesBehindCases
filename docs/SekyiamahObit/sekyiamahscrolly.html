The Parliament House and State House? Too small. Christiansborg Castle was the seat of the government, but it is also a former Danish-Norwegian slave castle. That would not be appropriate.<p></p> <br> <p></p>Veteran diplomat Kofi Sekyiamah, then a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Information, was part the planning committee that took a different approach and recommended Independence Square. It holds deep symbolism for the country, the first sub-Saharan nation to free itself from European colonialism. The choice paid off. An estimated 500,000 Ghanaians flocked to the square, a vast expanse along the Atlantic Ocean with several dramatic monuments. Clinton, despite being overdressed for the sweltering conditions, was grateful, and called the event a “rousing start” to his six-nation tour of the continent in his memoir. <p></p> <br> <p></p>The event was among the many tasks that Sekyiamah undertook during his long career as a civil servant at home and abroad for Ghana’s foreign service. A year after Clinton’s visit, Sekyiamah helped plan another high profile visit to Ghana, this time by Queen Elizabeth -- a monarch who had ascended to the throne in Great Britain when Ghana was still one of its colonies. </section> <section id="scrolly"> <article> <div class="step" data-image="url(Sekyiamah8!.jpeg)"> <p>Sekyiamah died at a hospital in Accra on Jan. 23, 2021. The cause was complications of Covid-19, his daughter, the writer and feminist activist Nana Darkoa Sekyiamah said. He was 82. </p> <p> He was among the earliest crop of diplomats to represent the newly independent country of Ghana. Its first leader, Kwame Nkrumah, sought to define a distinct foreign policy, helping other African colonies in their struggles for political independece. Nkrumah also pursued a strategy of non-alignment, avoiding taking sides during the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Sekyiamah's first overseas posting was to Tanzania. In the 1970s, still in his thirties, he was a vice-president of the United Nations’s 27th General Assembly and chaired an influential committee at the UN’s Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. </p> <p>After his work with the commission, Sekyiamah was Ghana’s deputy ambassador to what is now the European Union in Brussels.</p> </div> <div class="step" data-image="url(Sekyiamah6.jpeg)"> <p>But his friends and fellow members at the Dohazari Squash Club in Accra saw a different side to the career civil servant. To them, Kofi Sekyiamah’s cocktail creations were the must-have after intense games on the court.</p> <p>“He had his own ways of concocting drinks,” said Francis Tsegah, Ghana’s ambassador to Spain from 2004 to 2009 and a close friend of Sekyiamah.</p> <p>His most famous mixture was called “2-2-1” which was made of two shots each of Herb Afric and Mandingo bitters and a shot of juice from the lemons growing in his house.</p> <p>He played squash regularly even as he reached his eighties returning to the court about three times a week. He developed his love for squash through his younger brother Nana Victor, who was an Air Force officer and represented Ghana internationally in the sport.</p> <p>“What really kept him going, what made him happy was his time on the squash court. Squash was his life,” Ambassador Tsegah said. </p> </div> <div class="step" data-image="url(Sekyiamah5!.jpeg)"> <p>Eugene Kofi Sekyiamah was born on April 21, 1938 in Sekondi, along Ghana’s western coast, and was brought up in Accra. He preferred not to use his European first name. His father Kojo Hammond Sekyiamah was a bursar at Legon Hall at the University of Ghana and his mother Henrietta Dakoa was an educator who worked in the civil service to help set up daycare centers and nurseries around the country. He was the third of seven children.</p> <p>Sekyiamah attended Tamale Secondary School in northern Ghana, and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Ghana in 1964 and a diploma in public administration from the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration a year later. He also took courses on the workings of the United Nations and diplomacy at Uppsala University in Sweden and the University of Oxford in England.</p> <p>Despite his early career success in the foreign servive, it took nearly another three decades for Sekyiamah to become full ambassador. he was recalled from his overseas post and he held a string of senior roles across Ghana’s civil service at the ministries of finance and trade before retiring in 2004 as chief director, the topmost civil servant, at the Ministry of Information.</p> <p>“He joined the foreign service right from the university and for a foreigh service officer, the ultimate is to become an ambassador,” his friend Ambassador Tsegah said.</p> </div> <div class="step" data-image="url(Sekyiamah7!.jpeg)"> <p>In 2006, Sekyiamah was recalled from retirement and appointed by President John Kuffuor to become Ghana’s high commissioner to Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands states.</p> <p>He ended his diplomatic duties in 2009 and lived a life devoted to his family and mixing cocktails with his squash friends.</p> <p>Sekyiamah was polygamously married. In addition to his second wife, Rosemarie Addo whom he met in Geneva in 1971 and their three children, he is survived by two sisters, a brother and two grandchildren. His first wife, Olga June Sekyiamah, died a couple of years ago.</p> </div> </article> <div class="sticky-thing"> </div> </section> <section id="outro"></section> </main>  <script src="https://unpkg.com/intersection-observer@0.5.1/intersection-observer.js"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/scrollama"></script> <script>var e=document.querySelector("main"),t=e.querySelector("#scrolly"),r=t.querySelector(".sticky-thing"),s=t.querySelector("article"),c=s.querySelectorAll(".step"),a=scrollama();function i(e){var t=e.element;c.forEach(function(e){return e.classList.remove("is-active")}),t.classList.add("is-active"),r.style.backgroundImage=t.dataset.image}function l(){a.setup({step:"#scrolly article .step",offset:.33}).onStepEnter(i),window.addEventListener("resize",a.resize)}l();</script> </body></html>
